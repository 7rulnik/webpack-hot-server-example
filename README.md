This project originated from an internal work project that **worked flawlessly**.
Unfortunately, it's been impossible to replicate up to this point.


### Help Wanted

- [ ] Webpack requires restarting several times before changes are picked up.
- [ ] HMR only works _once_, not with subsequent saves.
